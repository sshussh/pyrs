## 0.95.0 — Generators as arguments to the eager builtins

A generator function could only be consumed by a `for` loop or a
comprehension. Every eager builtin rejected one, so `list(g())` — probably the
most common thing anyone does with a generator — was a compile error, and the
only way to get the values out was to write the loop by hand.

- `list`, `set`, `sorted`, `sum`, `max`, `min` and `str.join` accept a
  generator. These drain their argument anyway, so the generator is
  materialized first and side effects, order and result are identical to
  consuming it lazily.
- `any` and `all` accept a generator and **short-circuit**, stopping as soon
  as the answer is known. They cannot materialize first: a side-effecting or
  infinite generator would behave differently from CPython. (Over a list they
  still walk the whole sequence, where it is unobservable.)
- `tuple(gen)` is still rejected, because tuples are fixed-arity here; the
  existing diagnostic says so.
- Fixed alongside: an unannotated generator hard-coded its yield type to
  `int`, so `def g(): yield "a"` failed with a type mismatch at the yield and
  a `str`, `float` or `bool` generator could not be written at all without a
  return annotation. The yield type is now taken from the first `yield` of a
  literal or an annotated parameter, searched through `if` / `for` / `while` /
  `try` / `with` bodies, and the three signature-collection sites agree with
  the lowering site — a mismatch there gave a call site a different element
  type than the body produced.

## 0.94.0 — User-defined exception classes

`class E(Exception)` had no spelling: the exception type in `raise` / `except`
was resolved by the *parser* against a hardcoded list of builtins. Unlike most
open gaps there was no workaround — only falling back to a builtin type, which
loses the distinction the program is making.

- `class E(Exception): pass` and chains (`class B(A)`) are supported. A
  subclass is caught by any ancestor and by `except Exception`; a base is not
  caught by its subclass; unrelated user exceptions do not catch each other.
- `raise E`, `raise E()` and `raise E("msg")` all work, for user classes and
  builtins alike. These first two forms were previously rejected outright.
- An uncaught exception with no message prints just the type name, as CPython
  does: `raise ValueError()` reports `ValueError`, not `ValueError: `. The
  bound `e` and its message are empty in that case rather than repeating the
  type name.
- Builtin exceptions are unaffected, including the `OSError` family, and a
  tuple filter may mix user and builtin types.
- Exception-name resolution moved from the parser to the semantic phase, which
  is the only place that knows which classes exist. The parser no longer
  validates exception names against a fixed list.
- Deliberately rejected, each with a diagnostic that says why rather than a
  generic one: methods or fields on an exception class (it carries a tag and a
  name, with no instance layout); using an exception class as a value
  (`x = E("m")`) — the name exists, the use does not; subclassing
  `GeneratorExit`, which is BaseException-only in CPython so `except Exception`
  would miss the subclass; and a base declared after its subclass, which
  CPython rejects with NameError.

## 0.93.0 — Conditional expressions

`a if c else b` was a parse error. Unlike the other open gaps this one is not
an exotic corner: it is one of the most common expressions in Python, and
`x = "big" if n > 3 else "small"` had no spelling at all.

- Conditional expressions are supported everywhere an expression is:
  assignments, returns, call arguments and defaults, subscripts and slices,
  container literals, f-strings, `while` and `assert` conditions, comprehension
  elements, generators and closures.
- Only the selected branch is evaluated, so the guard idioms work:
  `1 // n if n else -1` does not divide by zero, and `xs[0] if xs else "empty"`
  does not raise. The condition is evaluated exactly once.
- Precedence and associativity match Python: `or`/`not` bind tighter
  (`0 or 2 if False else 9` is `9`), chains are right-associative, and the
  condition itself is an `or_test`, so CPython's rejection of
  `1 if 2 if 3 else 4 else 5` is reproduced rather than silently nested.
- A bare conditional is excluded from comprehension iterables and filters, as
  in CPython: the trailing `if` in `[x for x in a if b]` belongs to the
  comprehension. `[x for x in range(3) if 1 if True else 0]` is rejected with a
  diagnostic pointing at the `else`.
- Mixed numeric branches keep each branch's own type, so `1 if c else 2.5` is
  `1`, not `1.0` — the same rule 0.89 established for `[1, 2.5]`. Unrelated
  branch types (`1 if c else "s"`) become a union.
- Arithmetic and comparison on a mixed-numeric union remain unsupported, as
  they already were for list elements. That diagnostic now explains why and
  suggests two fixes that were checked to work — give the parts one type, or
  narrow with `isinstance`. `float(x)` on the union and annotating the target
  do not work and are no longer implied.

## 0.92.0 — String literal escapes and PEP 701 f-strings

Two gaps found while testing the Unicode milestones. Both were silent wrong
answers in the supported surface rather than missing features.

- String literals decode `\xNN`, `\uXXXX`, `\UXXXXXXXX`, one-to-three-digit
  octal (`\101`) and the control escapes `\a \b \f \v`. The lexer previously
  recognised only `\n \t \r \0 \\ \' \"`, so `"\x00"` survived as the four
  characters `\`, `x`, `0`, `0` and `len` reported `4`. Unknown escapes still
  survive verbatim, as in CPython.
- Malformed escapes are rejected with a specific message —
  `truncated \xXX escape`, `truncated \uXXXX escape`,
  `illegal Unicode character U+11FFFF` — instead of being mangled.
- Two forms CPython accepts are rejected deliberately, with a diagnostic
  rather than a wrong answer: a lone surrogate (`"\ud800"`), which has no
  UTF-8 form and so cannot be represented in a PyRs string, and `\N{NAME}`,
  which needs the Unicode name database the compiler does not carry.
  `chr(0xD800)` still produces the bytes at run time.
- f-string replacement fields accept string literals in either quote,
  including the quote delimiting the f-string: `f"{d["k"]}"` (PEP 701). The
  f-string token was a regex that stopped at the first unescaped quote; it is
  now a scanner tracking brace depth and nested literals. The parser's brace
  scan and its `!` / `:` split skip nested literals too, so `f"{'}'}"` and
  `f"{d[':']}"` are correct.
- An unterminated single-quoted f-string now reports
  `unterminated f-string literal` rather than `unexpected character`.

## 0.91.0 — Unicode case transforms and character classes

0.90 made string offsets code points; this makes character *properties*
Unicode too, closing the last rows of the measured-defect table. The tables in
`codegen/runtime/unicode_data.c` are generated by
`scripts/gen_unicode_tables.py`, which asks the installed CPython about every
code point rather than re-parsing the UCD — the same interpreter the
differential tests compare against. `make hygiene` fails if the stamped
Unicode version stops matching the running interpreter.

- `upper`, `lower`, `title`, `capitalize`, `swapcase` and `casefold` follow
  Unicode 16.0.0, including mappings that change length: `"ß".upper()` is now
  `"SS"`, `"ﬁ".upper()` is `"FI"`, and `"naïve café".upper()` is
  `"NAÏVE CAFÉ"`. Titlecase characters are handled, so `"ǅungla".title()`
  matches CPython.
- `isalpha`, `isdigit`, `isdecimal`, `isnumeric`, `isalnum`, `isspace`,
  `isupper`, `islower`, `istitle`, `isprintable` and `isidentifier` use
  Unicode categories and derived properties. `"é".isalpha()` is now `True`,
  `"²".isdigit()` is `True` while `"²".isdecimal()` is `False`, and
  identifiers accept `café` and `π`. `isascii` is now a header comparison.
- Whitespace-driven `strip`, `split` and `rsplit` use the Unicode whitespace
  set and scan by character, so a multi-byte character can no longer be split
  by a byte that happens to match.
- `repr` escapes by Unicode printability rather than byte range, both for
  `!r` and for strings printed inside a container: `repr("café")` is
  `'café'`, and a zero-width space is escaped.
- Table cost: 303 distinct records cover all 1.1M code points; 155 KiB of C
  that compiles in 40 ms, against the C runtime's existing 2.2 s.
- Still open, and stated rather than implied: no normalization or
  grapheme-cluster segmentation (`len` counts code points, so `"e" + U+0301`
  is 2); no locale-sensitive casing beyond CPython's default; lone-surrogate
  and encoding-error behavior is unspecified; indexing a non-ASCII string is
  O(n), not CPython's O(1).
- One suite change: the `while_local_optional_reassign_none_terminates`
  timeout went from 5s to 30s. Its budget has to cover a full `pyrs compile`
  (~2.4 s serially, dominated by building the C runtime) under a saturated
  parallel test run; it exists to catch an infinite loop, and the file's other
  timeout tests already used 15s.

## 0.90.0 — Unicode code point offsets

String offsets are Unicode code points, matching CPython. `PyrsStr` stays a
UTF-8 buffer and gains a cached code point count as its first header word, so
`len(s)` is O(1), codegen's `emit_len` is unchanged, and `print`, file I/O,
hashing, comparison and the CPython bridge keep operating on bytes. ASCII
strings are recognised as `cplen == len` and keep the existing paths.

- `len`, indexing, slicing (including a step), iteration, `list(str)` and
  `set(str)` count and select whole characters across 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-byte
  code points, combining sequences and an embedded NUL. `len("héllo")` is now
  `5`, `"héllo"[1]` is `é`, and `len("🐍")` is `1`.
- `find`/`rfind`/`index`/`rindex`/`count` return character offsets and accept
  character `start`/`end` bounds, as do `startswith`/`endswith`.
  `"héllo".find("l")` is now `2`.
- `split`/`rsplit`/`partition`/`rpartition`/`splitlines` and the `strip`
  family never split a character; `strip(chars)` compares whole code points
  instead of bytes, so it can no longer leave an invalid sequence behind.
- `center`/`ljust`/`rjust`/`zfill`/`expandtabs` and f-string format widths and
  precision measure characters, and a multi-byte fill character is written
  whole. `translate`/`maketrans` key on code point ordinals. `ord` is O(1).
- Fixed alongside: four string allocation sites hand-rolled the old header
  layout (exception messages, object reprs, generator `throw`), one of which
  corrupted the heap once the header changed.
- Indexing a non-ASCII string is O(n), not CPython's O(1). A one-entry
  sequential-access memo, invalidated on every collection, keeps `for c in s`
  and index loops linear. On this host a string-saturated ASCII workload costs
  5.3%; code that touches no strings is unaffected.
- Case transforms (`upper`, `lower`, `title`, …) and the `is*` predicates keep
  their documented ASCII-only behavior. `"ß".upper()` is still `ß` and
  `"é".isalpha()` is still `False`; the generated Unicode 16.0.0 tables are the
  next milestone. Offsets and properties are now separate, so no operation
  counts bytes while another counts characters.
- Not addressed, and unrelated to offsets: the lexer accepts no `\xNN` or
  `\uXXXX` escapes, and an f-string replacement field cannot contain nested
  quotes.

## 0.89.0 — Value fidelity: numeric literals and default `!=`

- Mixed-numeric list and tuple literals keep each element's own type instead of
  promoting to one: `[1, 2.5, 1]` prints `[1, 2.5, 1]`, not `[1.0, 2.5, 1.0]`.
  `join_elem_types` builds a union for mixed `(int, float)`, `(int, bool)` and
  `(float, bool)` pairs; homogeneous literals are unaffected and keep
  single-type storage. The default-argument inference path was joining with the
  scalar-assignment rule and now agrees.
- A class defining `__eq__` with no `__ne__` anywhere in its ancestry gets one
  synthesized, calling `self.__eq__` negated through the normal vtable. `a != b`
  where `a` is `Base`-typed but holds a `Child` defining `__ne__` now reaches
  `Child.__ne__`, keeping both its result and its side effects. Synthesis walks
  classes parent-first so an ancestor's explicit `__ne__` is never shadowed.
- Converting an already-typed `list[int]` to `list[float]` or to a union by
  assignment remains unsupported; only a literal's own elements are joined.
  Recorded as its own roadmap item rather than implied closed.

## 0.88.0 — Trustworthy validation gates

- The example parity gate fails when either process fails, instead of comparing
  only captured output.
- Integration tests build under `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR` (`target/tmp`, the path CI
  uploads) and retain their inputs when the thread is panicking, so a failing
  test leaves usable artifacts.
- `make hygiene` checks version agreement across 20 sites and resolves every
  relative documentation link, and its own failure paths are tested.
- `make asan` / `make ubsan` build the adapter, runtime and collector
  instrumented and run the extension boundary suite. The LLVM-generated kernel
  object is not instrumented; this is adapter and runtime coverage.

## 0.87.0 — String annotations and `__future__` imports

- Annotations written as string literals are accepted and resolved, including
  nested generics, unions and `Optional`, forward references to the enclosing
  class, and local variable annotations.
- `from __future__ import annotations` is accepted as a no-op, as are the other
  mandatory-in-Python-3 future features.
- Multidimensional slice syntax (`a[i, j]`) and matrix multiplication (`@`) are
  rejected with specific diagnostics naming what is missing, rather than a
  generic parse error.

## 0.86.0 — CPython interoperability and stranded correctness fixes

Native compilation is the default; the target workload family is scientific/data
Python, including NumPy and pandas through optional CPython compatibility
execution. Reaching 0.86.0 does not establish 1.0 readiness; see the
[roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the remaining gates.

- Borrowed list headers from the CPython bridge carry a non-owned capacity
  marker, so every runtime growth site raises `BufferError` instead of calling
  the libc allocator on exporter- or `PyMem`-owned memory. Previously a resize
  would free a foreign pointer, corrupt the heap and invalidate a buffer lease
  that still had to be released. Read-only enforcement no longer rests solely on
  the extension frontend's allowlist.

- Python-style script, `-c` and stdin invocation, with script arguments and
  native `sys.argv[0]` preserved on Unix. Existing compiler subcommands remain.
- Explicit `--compat` executes a whole script, command or `-m` package using
  CPython. Select an environment with `--python` or `PYRS_PYTHON`. This mode uses
  installed Python packages and preserves their semantics; it does not compile
  them or accelerate them. It is never an automatic retry of native execution.
- `pyrs check -i script.py` checks the native frontend/import graph without
  linking or executing code. Optimization levels outside 0–3 are rejected.
- Private, atomically created temporary build directories with automatic cleanup
  on normal completion and ordinary compiler errors.
- Exact mixed integer/float comparisons, including bigints, fractional values,
  NaN and infinities, and numeric equality through boxed list values.
- Correct bigint-to-float ties-to-even rounding and overflow, and float-to-int
  conversion at the positive small-integer boundary (`2**62`).
- Binding checks for conditionally assigned locals, including zero/False/None
  values and generator suspension. Locals modified inside `try` survive exception
  handling at optimized compilation levels. Module globals, deletion and static
  use-before-assignment diagnostics remain separate work.
- Preserve side effects and unbound reads in None identity comparisons and
  `print(sep=.../end=...)` expressions with a None result.
- Versioned compatibility probes and reports that distinguish native gaps from
  compatibility passes and compare streams, exit status and generated files.
- Experimental `build-extension` target: compile numerical function modules into
  CPython extensions on Linux. Native library analysis/emission is separate from
  the Python adapter and does not require or automatically call `main()`.
- Extension functions can return strings: native UTF-8 is copied into a Python
  string while the result remains rooted. Invalid UTF-8 raises UnicodeDecodeError
  with input buffers released normally. String arguments remain unsupported.
- Exact scalar boundary guards, arbitrary-size integer conversion, keyword
  binding, native exception translation and read-only 1D float64 buffer borrowing.
  Python lists of floats use temporary copies; NumPy/pandas buffers can pass
  without copying. Buffer leases are released on ordinary success and failure.
- Native extension boundary tests at O0/O2/O3 under GC stress, including lifetime,
  thread/reentrancy, symbol isolation, and scientific package checks. The
  `examples/interop` demo verifies results and measures full call overhead.
- The bridge remains an explicit numerical API; automatic mixed execution,
  general objects/arrays and a stable standalone library ABI remain planned
  work. See the [interoperability contract](docs/INTEROPERABILITY.md) for
  current restrictions.
- Known gaps recorded rather than claimed fixed: string length/indexing still
  operate on UTF-8 bytes, and mixed numeric list literals still promote ints to
  floats. Both are reported as `known_gap` by the compatibility probes.
- CI wiring for the compatibility probes is deferred: the required
  `scientific-compatibility` job would have made every run depend on installing
  NumPy/pandas from PyPI. `make ci` runs the probes locally in the meantime.
